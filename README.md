## 🌍 Unlocking Open Source for Global Health

**Enable the discovery of SDG-aligned open-source projects — starting with SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being.**

Open-source repositories have immense potential to accelerate progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). But with over **300 million public repositories on GitHub**, there is no universal way to identify, track, or measure how these projects align with the SDGs.

Our project bridges that gap by allowing developers to categorize their projects using structured metadata, making impactful health-related open-source projects easier to discover and support.

---

## 🔥 Why This Matters

- **🚫 Lack of Standardization**  
  No structured metadata exists to label projects by SDG relevance.

- **🧭 Missed Opportunities**  
  Funders, researchers, and contributors struggle to discover relevant solutions.

- **🌐 UN Demand**  
  The United Nations is actively seeking ways to map real-world software to SDGs—but there’s no scalable solution… until now.

---

## ✅ Our Solution

We created a workflow that enables open-source maintainers to self-identify how their work supports SDGs using **simple, structured metadata** formats like JSON, YAML, or Markdown.

With this, projects can be:

- 🔍 Easily searched and filtered by SDG relevance  
- 📊 Tracked by stakeholders like the UN, funders, and researchers  
- 📡 Integrated into GitHub, dashboards, and developer portals  

We piloted this on **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being**, with scalability across all 17 SDGs.
